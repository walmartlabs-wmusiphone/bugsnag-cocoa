Have you:

* Commented the code sufficiently?
* Added a CHANGELOG entry, if necessary?
* Checked the scope to ensure the commits are only related to the goal above?	
* Considered asynchronicity and thread safety?
* Added any new headers to the "Copy Files" stage of the static iOS target?	
* Chosen the correct target branch?
* Considered all of the pre-release checks (see CONTRIBUTING.md), if this is a full release?
